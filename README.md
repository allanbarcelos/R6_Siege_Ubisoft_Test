# R6_Siege_Ubisoft_Test

The test aims to evaluate the ability to process large volumes of data, optimizing memory and disk usage, without depending on external services. Specifically:

1. **Calculate the 100 highest average eliminations per operator** from data from the last 7 days, generating a file `operator_top100_YYYYMMDD.txt`.
2. **Optional**: For each player, identify their 10 best matches in terms of eliminations, generating a file `player_top10_YYYYMMDD.txt`.
3. Deal with potentially corrupt daily log files and ensure the system is efficient to run daily in a Linux environment while consuming less than 1 GB of RAM.

# Understanding Process

Although the project described in the test doesn't directly require Machine Learning (ML), there are opportunities to apply ML to enhance the system or extract more value from the data.

Here are some ways ML could be applied in this context:

### 1. **Operator Performance Pattern Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Discover patterns or make predictions about operator performance in matches.
   - **How to apply**: I could use regression models or time series analysis to predict an operator’s future kill count based on previous performances, as well as factors such as map, opposing team, or the player’s gameplay style.

### 2. **Player Behavior Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Identify different player profiles (e.g., aggressive vs. defensive players, or preferred operators based on skill level).
   - **How to apply**: Clustering algorithms like K-Means could be used to segment players based on their playstyle (e.g., kill counts, operators chosen, maps played).

### 3. **Anomaly and Fraud Detection**
   - **Objective**: Detect abnormal behavior, such as cheating or unexpected performance from operators/players.
   - **How to apply**: Anomaly detection algorithms like Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM could be employed to flag matches with unusual behavior, such as an operator with historically low kill rates suddenly performing exceptionally well.

### 4. **Operator Recommendations for Better Performance**
   - **Objective**: Recommend operators to players based on their past performance and playstyle.
   - **How to apply**: Collaborative filtering recommendation models (similar to those used by streaming services) could suggest operators that are likely to improve a player’s kill count based on operators used by other players with similar profiles.

### 5. **Predicting Future Match Performance**
   - **Objective**: Estimate a player’s kill count or overall performance in a specific match.
   - **How to apply**: Classification or regression models (such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting) could be trained to predict performance based on historical data, including operator choice, map, and previous player performance.

### Summary
The core project focuses on data processing, but Machine Learning could be applied to provide predictive insights and recommendations, improve game balancing, and detect anomalies. Additionally, the data generated by the project (kill averages, player performance) could be used to train ML models to enhance player experience and performance analysis in the game.


# Setting Up the Environment

## Step 1: Create Project Directory

First, create a new directory for your project:

```bash
mkdir <project-directory>
cd <project-directory>
```

This will be the root folder for your project.

## Step 2: Set Up Python Virtual Environment

To keep your project dependencies isolated, set up a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

This creates a `venv` directory containing the virtual environment.

## Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment depending on your OS:

- On **Linux/MacOS**:

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- On **Windows**:

  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

## Step 4: Install Dependencies

After activation, install all required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can generate or update the `requirements.txt` file using the following command (after installing necessary libraries):

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## Additional Tips:

- To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:

  ```bash
  deactivate
  ```

- Always remember to activate the virtual environment before working on the project or running scripts to avoid conflicts with global packages.
