# R6_Siege_Ubisoft_Test

The task is to design a system that processes daily logs from Rainbow Six Siege matches. The core objective is to compute and generate a daily report of the top 100 operators with the highest average eliminations over the past 7 days. Additionally, an optional requirement is to determine the top 10 highest-elimination games for each player.

Key challenges include efficiently processing large volumes of data (up to 30 million matches per day), handling corrupted log lines, and optimizing memory usage, with a strict limit of 1 GB. Intermediate data can be written to disk, but external systems such as databases or Hadoop are not permitted.
